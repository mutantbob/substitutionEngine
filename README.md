This is a javascript module for doing substitutions on HTML templates.

My original vision was to fetch JSON data via AJAX and then update the
HTML page.  By doing substitutions on a template embedded in the HTML
document it is easier to maintain than a bunch of custom javascript
that constructs the HTML nodes.
